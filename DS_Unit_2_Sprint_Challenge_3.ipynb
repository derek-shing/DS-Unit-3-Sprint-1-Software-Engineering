    "\n",
    "Your goal is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load, validate, and clean/prepare the data.\n",
    "2. Fit a logistic regression model\n",
    "3. Answer questions based on the results (as well as a few extra questions about the other modules)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good! Manage your time, and make sure to get to all parts. If you get stuck wrestling with the data, simplify it (if necessary, drop features or rows) so you're able to move on. If you have time at the end, you can go back and try to fix/improve.\n",

    "It has a variety of features - some are continuous, but many are categorical. You may find [pandas.get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html) (a method to one-hot encode) helpful!\n",
    "\n",
    "The features have dramatically different ranges. You may find [sklearn.preprocessing.minmax_scale](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.minmax_scale.html#sklearn.preprocessing.minmax_scale) helpful!"

    "Your data should now be in a state to fit a logistic regression. Use scikit-learn, define your `X` (independent variable) and `y`, and fit a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, present results - display coefficients in as interpretible a way as you can (hint - scaling the numeric features will help, as it will at least make coefficients more comparable to each other). If you find it helpful for interpretation, you can also generate predictions for cases (like our 5 year old rich kid on the Titanic) or make visualizations - but the goal is your exploration to be able to answer the question, not any particular plot (i.e. don't worry about polishing it).\n",

    "1. You are given data on academic performance of primary school students, and asked to fit a model to help predict \"at-risk\" students who are likely to receive the bottom tier of grades.\n",
    "2. You are studying tech companies and their patterns in releasing new products, and would like to be able to model and predict when a new product is likely to be launched.\n",
    "3. You are working on modeling expected plant size and yield with a laboratory that is able to capture fantastically detailed physical data about plants, but only of a few dozen plants at a time.\n",
